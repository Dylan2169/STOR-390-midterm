# STOR 390 Another Look at the (Im-)Precision of Individual Risk Estimates Made Using Actuarial Risk Assessment Instruments
This repository contains two files (a PDF and an RMD) for the midterm project in STOR 390 Machine Learning: Ethics and Society.

The paper investigates the methodologies, findings, and ethical concerns discussed in "Another Look at the (Im-)Precision of Individual Risk Estimates Made Using Actuarial Risk Assessment Instruments" by Stephen D. Hart and David J. Cooke. In this study, the authors examine the reliability of actuarial risk assessment instruments (ARAIs) in predicting individual recidivism rates, highlighting their statistical limitations and associated moral concerns.
